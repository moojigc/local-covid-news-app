# [COVID-19 News and Data App](https://moojigc.github.io/local-covid-news-app/)

Our website, using three APIs, shows the user COVID-19 statistics for their country and relevant news articles simultaneously, as an easy way of keeping up with the happenings of the virus.

By default, it will attempt to get the user's location data to determine their location. If this is rejected, the user can simply search their country and see the results.

Thanks to the Foundation CSS framework, we can easily provide responsive & unique experiences for both mobile and desktop users.
